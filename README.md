# OllamaSqlGen

This is a small experimental projet which generates a SQL query using
Meta's Llama 3.2 AI model.

## Running

Ensure that Ollama is installed. Then, run `ollama serve` to initialize
the Ollama inference server.

Navigate to the cloned directory and run `python sql_gen.py` to run
the program.
